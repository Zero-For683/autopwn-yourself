There is this exploit for the machine Strutted to gain initial access:
https://github.com/TAM-K592/CVE-2024-53677-S2-067/blob/ALOK/Check-CVE-2024-53677.py
https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Strutted


However it doesn't work, because of capitalization issues/other. So I'd like to make my own that tries capitalization/doesn't. Heres what the request that worked for me looks like

The "name="Upload" portion NEEDED to be capitalized like in the example for it to work

Once you've generated a script that appends all the required headers -->

Interact with the webshell and gain a revshell (using the other tool we plan on making first)
