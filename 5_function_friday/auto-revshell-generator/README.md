So, next week when I start this:

When you upload a webshell, or gain some sort of RCE, it can be such a pain to try every single revshell option from revshell.com 

I'd like to automate this process to try every combo until you get a hit.

SO, the script should: 

Start a listener
Try every single one until we get a connection
On connection show what revshell command we send to get the revshell
